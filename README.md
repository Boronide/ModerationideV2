# Moderationide
Moderationide V2:
A Bot for Boronide.

## About Moderationide
Moderationide is a discord bot for boronide.
ModerationideV2 is a rewrite by MathcelF (me)
-> Under main/cogs/commands/ you will find run.py
It was provided by X3: I rewrote it. 

Moderationide will be always open source.
It is a part of boronide so support can be received in Boronide Ticket System.

It would be nice to leave some credits for me:)
It took a bit of time, but it is done now.

## Changes?
In compare to Moderationide V1:
Data is stored on MongoDB, instead on the host... (Don't ask me, why it was like that)
Different Permission System, instead of having them on the local file:
User Data is stored on the DB (not sensitive information) such as Flags:
Flags will be calculated and if user has certain flags, he can use the commands.

Remade the Verification System.
Shame on Herrtt, he did not implement the backend somehow.
Or shame on the other website devs.


Project is a bit inconsistent in the style, so if you got suggestions / tips.
I am open for them.

Rewrote a lot, made stuff more efficent and 'OOP' even tho sometimes I mess up with somethings.


# Start & Host

Contabo, Hetzner are some vialable options.
